# take-inventory
Take Inventory is an inventory counting app built in react-native that consumes the Order Commander API. 
After using the app to count the given inventory, the lists/categories are exported as an excel workbook to a Dropbox account. 
From this point the lists are pasted into the order-helper workbook that offers a suggested order based on previous movement and current inventory levels.
